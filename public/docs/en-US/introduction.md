## API Endpoints

> Your app may need to detect NEON token deposits , count how many transactions were sent from an address 🔢 or check an address's ERC20 token balance 💎
​

For that you may find a suitable endpoint from our wide range of APIs that you can simply query to provide data while you remain fully focused on building your applications.

## Tutorials

> There is an overwhelming amount of data 📈 that can be extracted from the Fantom blockchain.

We've helped you take the first steps by writing some thorough tutorials on how to query and derive popular blockchain metrics.

For power users, we've also added guides such as how you can programmatically verify contracts through API calls and more advanced use cases of endpoints.
