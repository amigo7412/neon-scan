# FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions.

## Can the same API keys be used across different explorers?

Every block explorer built by Etherscan ( eg. BscScan, NeonScan, HecoInfo ) requires a different account to be created and hence a different set of API keys 🗝 .

## My API keys are not working, what can I do?

A technical glitch may have occurred in the key creation process. In this case, try deleting the key and generating a new one ✨
